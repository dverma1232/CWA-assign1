# Creating Web Apps - Assignment 1
My first assignment for the creating web apps unit at uni. The task was pretty simple, create a website for a specific niche, for example, mine was to create a website for a short training course of my choice. I chose to create one for a coding course. The website is built with HTML/CSS and utilising Bootstrap.
